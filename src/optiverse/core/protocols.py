"""
Protocols for structural subtyping in Optiverse.

This module defines Protocol classes that enable structural subtyping (duck typing
with type checking support). Use these instead of hasattr() checks for better
type safety and IDE support.

Example usage:
    from optiverse.core.protocols import Editable, Undoable

    def process_editable(item: Editable) -> None:
        # Type checker knows item has edited signal and to_dict method
        item.edited.emit()
        data = item.to_dict()

    # Better than:
    def process_item(item) -> None:
        if hasattr(item, 'edited'):
            item.edited.emit()  # No type checking here
